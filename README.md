# Developmental Django server for Joy Studio 
The development server was mainly built for learning and proof of concept. The build concept was to digitalize Joy Studio, a nutrition club. 

It allows users to login and save their weekly or even daily stats which display on their profile. Users can also view announcements (WIP) and book appointments (IDEA ONLY).

Uses Google spreadsheets API as a database for better end-user access to the data.

Currently deployed to heroku -> [https://joy-studio.herokuapp.com/](https://joy-studio.herokuapp.com/ "herokuapp.com")
